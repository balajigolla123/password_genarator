# Python Password Generator and Strength Checker

## 1. Project Title
Python Password Generator and Strength Checker using Git and GitHub

---

## 2. Project Overview
This project is a Python-based command-line application that helps users generate strong and secure passwords and check their strength. The project also demonstrates the practical usage of Git and GitHub, including branching, multiple commits, merging, and merge conflict resolution.

---

## 3. Problem Statement
In today’s digital world, users often create weak or predictable passwords, which makes their accounts vulnerable to cyberattacks. 
Many users also lack awareness of how strong their passwords actually are.
This project aims to solve this problem by generating secure passwords and evaluating their strength automatically.

---

## 4. Objectives of the Project
- To generate strong and random passwords using Python  
- To analyze and classify password strength  
- To apply Python programming concepts in a real-world problem  
- To understand Git and GitHub version control workflows  
- To practice branching, merging, and conflict resolution  

---

## 5. Features Implemented
- Random password generation  
- Password strength checking (Weak / Medium / Strong)  
- Password history (last 5 generated passwords)  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Modular Python code structure  
- Git branching and merging  
- Merge conflict creation and resolution  

---

## 6. Technologies Used
- Python  
- Git  
- GitHub  
- VS Code  
- Command Line / Git Bash

## 8. Explanation of Files
- **main.py**: Main program that connects all modules and handles user input  
- **password_generator.py**: Generates random secure passwords  
- **strength_checker.py**: Checks and returns password strength  
- **utils.py**: Stores password history and utility functions  
- **README.md**: Project documentation

## 9. Python Concepts Used
- Functions  
- Conditional statements  
- Loops  
- Lists  
- Exception handling (try-except)  
- Modular programming  

---

## 10. Git Branches Used
- **main** – Final stable branch  
- **feature-generator** – Password generation feature  
- **feature-strength** – Password strength checking feature  
- **feature-utils** – Password history feature  
- **feature-validation** – Input validation and error handling

## 11. Git Commands Used
- `git init`  
- `git status`  
- `git add`  
- `git commit`  
- `git branch`  
- `git checkout`  
- `git merge`  
- `git push`  
- `git log`

## 12. Commit Strategy
The project follows a meaningful commit strategy with more than 10 commits. Each commit represents a logical change such as adding a feature, improving code, resolving conflicts, or updating documentation.

---

## 13. Merge Conflict Handling
A merge conflict was intentionally created by modifying the same line in two different branches. Git was unable to automatically merge the changes, so the conflict was resolved manually by editing the file and committing the resolved version. This demonstrates real-world Git conflict handling.
